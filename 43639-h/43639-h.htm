<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the very heart of Europe lies a small
country nestling among the mountains. It is
unlike any other in the world. Its people
speak four different languages; they believe in
different religions; the government is not alike
in different parts; yet the Swiss states are
bound together by a bond stronger than unity
of language or creed can possibly make.</p>

<p>Our brave Swiss cousins believe in liberty
for all and brotherly love. These make the
most powerful of ties.</p>

<p>In their mountains and valleys they have
fought against the enemies who would have
destroyed them, and the tyrants who would
have made them slaves. They have driven
out their foes again and again, for their cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
was noble and unselfish, and to-day the republic
formed by them can teach other countries
many wise and worthy lessons.</p>

<p>How the stories of William Tell and Arnold
von Winkelried stir our hearts whenever we
hear them repeated! These were only two
of many heroes who have made the country
famous for its bravery and unselfishness.</p>

<p>Surely we shall be glad to turn our minds
for a while to its fertile valleys, beautiful lakes,
and the noble mountains among which the
good monks live with their trusty dogs, that
they may give aid and comfort to unfortunate
travellers overtaken by cold and storm.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>Our Little Swiss Cousin</div>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CARL'S HOLIDAY</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">To-morrow</span>, to-morrow!" Carl kept repeating
to himself.</p>

<p>He was standing at the window of the little
cottage and looking out toward the great
mountain. He had lived under its shadow
all his life. Its snowy summit was coloured
a fiery red as it stood against the sky in the
sunset light. People in far-away lands would
give a great deal to see such a glorious sight.</p>

<p>But Carl saw another picture in his mind.
It was the grand procession of the next day,
that would celebrate the close of school before
the summer vacation. Thousands of children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
would march in the line. They would carry
the flag of Switzerland,&mdash;the white cross on
a red ground. It was the emblem of their
country's freedom, and they loved it well.</p>

<p>There would be bands of music; there
would be a speech by the mayor of the city.
Feasts would be spread, to which all the children
were invited. Yes, the glorious day was
near, and Carl was very happy.</p>

<p>"Carl, my boy, are you thinking of the
good time to-morrow?" said a voice at the
other side of the room.</p>

<p>Carl started, and, turning round, he saw his
father standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"O father, is that you? How glad I am
to see you!" and the little boy rushed into the
good man's arms.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am all ready for the festival.
Mother has my best clothes laid out on the
bed. She is planning to go, too, and now
you are home just in time to go with us. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
am very, very glad." Carl was so excited
that he talked faster than usual.</p>

<p>"I am tired of working in a hotel in the
city, the country is so much pleasanter," answered
his father. "And now I shall spend
the summer with your mother and you. The
people of the village wish me to take the cows
to the mountain pasture. You shall go, too,
and we will have a good time together."</p>

<p>"That will be fine. I never spent the
whole summer there before. How soon are
we to start, father?"</p>

<p>"Next week. The days are growing warmer
and the flowers must already be in bloom upon
the Alps. But now we must see your mother
and talk about to-morrow. On my way home
I heard in the village that you were going to
the festival. Nearly all the neighbours are
going too, aren't they?"</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and a
kind-faced woman came in, bringing a pail of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
milk in each hand. Her eyes were as blue
as the sky, and her hair was nearly as fair as
Carl's. It was easy to see that she was the
boy's mother.</p>

<p>A happy smile lighted her face when she
saw who was in the room. It was as much
a surprise to her as it had been to Carl. She
supposed her husband was still working in the
big hotel at Lucerne, where so many strangers
came from other lands.</p>

<p>When her husband told her of the work he
had been doing, the heavy trunks which he
had to lift till his back had grown lame, her
face grew full of pity.</p>

<p>"It was too hard for you, Rudolf," she
cried. "It is far better for you to take care
of the cows this summer. We will go with
you, Carl and I, and we shall have a merry
time."</p>

<p>She moved quickly about the room as she
strained the milk into the crocks and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ready the simple supper. In a few minutes
the little family gathered around the table.
There was sweet, fresh milk from the cows.
There was the black rye bread which Carl had
been used to eating all his life,&mdash;indeed, he
had never seen white bread in his home. Besides
these, there was a round cheese, from
which each one cut a slice as he wished.</p>

<p>Best of all, there was a sort of cake made
of dough and chopped dried fruits. Apples
and cherries and almonds were all mixed in
this cake and Carl thought it was very nice.
It was put on the table to-night in honour of
his father's home-coming.</p>

<p>Night after night Carl had a supper like this.
Morning after morning, the breakfast was the
same. The only difference was that sometimes
there was the cake with the dried fruits.</p>

<p>Yet Carl was very happy and healthy. To
be sure, he had meat and coffee for dinner
only once a week. This was on Sunday. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was no wonder that he looked forward to that
day as the best of all, for it seemed a feast day
to him. At the noon meal on other days
there was only soup or potatoes with the
bread and cheese. There was little change
through the year except at the time when the
fruit and nuts were ripe and they could be
eaten fresh.</p>

<p>After the supper was over, the family sat a
while longer around the table and talked about
the school festival. Carl's father had just
come from Lucerne. He told the boy how
the buildings were decorated. He named the
bands that would furnish the music.</p>

<p>"I am to march, father," Carl said. "And
I am to carry the flag of my country. Children
from all the villages around the lake are
to take part, I hear. Just think! although we
are back in the country, our school has its
place in the procession."</p>

<p>Carl's mother showed her husband the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
bright red skirt that she was going to wear.
It would reach to the tops of her shoes.
There was a white waist with big sleeves that
she had starched and ironed. There was a
new black bodice she had just made; it
would be laced about the waist, and it fitted
her finely. She had polished the bands of
silver to fasten across the back of her head
above the long braids of glossy hair. She
would certainly look very well in her finery,
and her husband would be proud of her. Oh,
yes, that was certain.</p>

<p>What kind of a hat would she wear? None
at all! There was no need, and it would be
a shame to hide the silver bands; they were
too pretty. What did it matter if some of
the women of Switzerland dressed like the
people of other lands? Carl's mother was
not ready to follow new fashions yet awhile.
The old customs of her village were good
enough for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a small room where Carl and his
parents sat and talked. Everything was fresh
and clean; the floor had been scrubbed so that
no spot could be seen upon it. The table was
unpainted. The chairs had straight, stiff backs;
no rocking-chair or lounge had ever found a
place here. Carl's mother had never rested herself
on such a piece of furniture in her life.</p>

<p>There was one strange-looking object in
the room. It was large and white. It
reached far up toward the ceiling, and was
made of porcelain. It was the family stove.
It had belonged to Carl's great-grandfather,
and had stood in this very place, summer and
winter, for a hundred years at least. It would
not seem like home without it.</p>

<p>When baby Carl was first old enough to
notice things around him, he used to creep up
to the stove and try to touch the pictures
painted on its sides. One was the scene of
a battle where the Swiss were driving their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
enemies down a mountain. On the other
side, a hunter was painted. He was bringing
home a chamois that hung from his shoulders.</p>

<p>When the boy grew older, he used to climb
the steps that led up to the top of the stove.
It was so nice and warm there behind the curtains
that hung from the ceiling down to the
front edge. It made a cosy little room where
Carl could lie and warm himself after a walk
in the winter air. Sometimes the boy slept
there all night long; but that was only in the
coldest weather.</p>

<p>In the daytime his mother often put her
fruit there to dry, or perhaps she hung wet
clothes there. It had many uses.</p>

<p>There were no real stairs in the house.
There was an upper room, however, and when
a person wished to enter it he must first climb
on top of the stove and then pass through a
hole in the ceiling. It was a strange way of
building the house; don't you think so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps you wonder that Carl did not get
burned when he lay on top of the stove.
That was because there was never any fire in
it! This probably seems the strangest thing
about it, but you must understand that the
fire was built in a sort of furnace out in the
hall. The heat passed from this furnace into
the porcelain stove, so it was not unpleasantly
warm when one touched it.</p>

<p>After talking a while with his father, Carl
climbed up to the top of the stove, and creeping
through the hole in the ceiling, he entered
his bedroom. He quickly said his prayers
and then jumped into bed. He must get to
sleep as early as possible, for he would be
called before daybreak. At least, his mother
promised to call him, but she did not need to
do so,&mdash;he was the first one in the house to
wake.</p>

<p>"Father! mother!" he shouted, before the
clock cried "cuckoo," three times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It was none too early; lights moving from
room to room could already be seen in the
neighbours' houses. The whole village was
astir.</p>

<p>There was a walk of several miles for all
who were going to the celebration. This walk
would bring them to the shores of the lake.
A steamer would be waiting at the pier to take
them across to the city of Lucerne on the
other side. A party of merry people moved
along the road just as the sunrise coloured the
mountain-tops. Every one was dressed in his
Sunday best.</p>

<p>There were many little girls, all in white,
their yellow hair hanging in long braids. Some
of them had immense wreaths of flowers or
laurel leaves to carry in the procession, but the
flags were carried by the boys.</p>

<p>See! there is the beautiful lake just ahead.
How blue its waters are! The shadows of
lofty mountains can be seen if you look down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
upon the clear surface. Brave men have lived
on its shores. Noble deeds have been done
near by. Every Swiss loves this lake, as he
thinks of the history of his country.</p>

<p>The little steamer was quickly loaded with
its gay passengers, and made its way over the
waters. Other steamers soon came in sight,
but all were moving in the same direction,&mdash;toward
the city of Lucerne.</p>

<p>Such a festival is not held every year. Each
village generally celebrates the close of school
by a picnic or steamer-ride. There is usually
something pleasant for the children, but not
always a time like this.</p>

<p>When the day was over, it was hard for Carl
to tell what he had enjoyed most. In the
morning, after the children had marched around
the city to lively music, they went out to a
large open space where the feast was served.
Every one had all the coffee and cakes he
wished. There were many odd little cakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that only Swiss women know how to make.
The children enjoyed them hugely.</p>

<p>After the feast games were played, and there
were rides on the flying horses. You will
laugh when you hear the name of one of the
games. It is "Blind Cow." Carl is very
fond of it. It is much like our "Blind Man's
Buff." Carl and his friend Franz chose one
corner of a large field. Marie, Franz's sister,
and Freda, another little friend, were with
them. They were soon joined by other children,
and they had a lively game.</p>

<p>Carl was the cow oftener than any one else.
He didn't care. It was great fun stumbling
around with blinded eyes, and trying to catch
the others. When they thought they were
quite safe and out of reach, one of them was
sure to laugh and show where he was. Then
Carl would make a sudden spring, and catch
the laugher.</p>

<p>Before the afternoon was over, the mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
spoke to the children about the kind teacher
who had helped not only the Swiss, but
children all over the world. That teacher's
name was Pestalozzi. Carl knew the story
well, but he loved to hear it over and over
again.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years ago there was a
good man who lived in Switzerland very near
Carl's house. It was a time of war. Soldiers
from other countries had chosen Switzerland
for their battle-field. They took possession of
the homes of the people. They destroyed
their crops. They ate their supplies of food.
The Swiss suffered greatly. After these enemies
had gone away, they found themselves
poor, and many of them were starving.</p>

<p>Pestalozzi was not a rich man, but his heart
was filled with pity. He went among the
poor and gave them all he had. He was
especially fond of the children. He cared
for them as well as he could; he got them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
bread to eat and clothes to wear; best of all,
he taught them and kept their minds busy.
But at last his money was all spent. What
could he do now?</p>

<p>He gathered the ragged, hungry boys
around him. They had grown to love him,
and were willing to do anything he directed.
He showed them how to sew and spin and do
many other kinds of work. They were soon
able to earn enough money to support themselves
and their school.</p>

<p>Pestalozzi did not teach in the way others
did. He said:</p>

<p>"It is not enough for these children to
study their lessons from books and then be
whipped if they do not get them. They must
see how real things are; they must study from
objects. The living birds and flowers should
help them. They must learn to shape things
for themselves, and see as much as possible
with their own eyes. Then they will love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
study; they will enjoy their schools, and be
happiest when there."</p>

<p>He set a new fashion for the world. His
pupils learned so fast and well that other
teachers came to watch and learn his ways.
His fame spread to other countries, to England
and America. They also copied his
manner of teaching. Not only Swiss children,
but those of different lands, began to
enjoy their schools better. It all came
about through the kind and loving work
of Pestalozzi.</p>

<p>Carl has never known of a boy being
whipped in his school. Such a punishment
is seldom given in Switzerland. The teacher
tries love and kindness first. If these fail, the
boy is turned out of school. It is a terrible
disgrace; it will follow the boy all his life, and
he dreads it above everything.</p>

<p>After the mayor had spoken of Pestalozzi
to the children, he bade them be proud of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
schools and their school-buildings, which were
finer than even the council-houses. He told
them to be glad that all children of Switzerland,
no matter how poor they were, could go
to these schools and learn of the great world
around them.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he could see in the faces of
thousands of little ones that they were proud
indeed.</p>

<p>Carl whispered to Franz, who stood beside
him:</p>

<p>"There is no country like ours, is there,
Franz? We could not be happy anywhere
else, I'm sure."</p>

<p>His friend replied, "No, indeed, Carl. It
is the home of free men, and we must grow up
to keep it so. I don't care if we do have to
study for six hours every school-day. We
learn all the faster and, besides, we have ever
so many holidays."</p>

<p>The best part of the holiday came in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
evening, for that was the time for fireworks.
There was a grand display on the shore of the
lake. There were rockets, and Roman candles,
and fire-pictures, and many other beautiful
pieces which lighted the sky and were
reflected in the waters of the lake. Many
of the people watched the display from the
decks of the little steamers, which were also
bright with coloured lights.</p>

<p>The time came all too soon for the homeward
journey.</p>

<p>"What a lovely time I've had," sighed
Carl, as he reached his own door. "I only
wish it were going to be to-morrow instead
of to-day."</p>

<p>"It was a fine show indeed," said his father.
"Everybody looked well and happy. But I
must say that I liked the dress of the people
of our own village better than that of any
other."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MOUNTAIN PASTURE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Here</span>, Carl, take this kettle, and you,
Franz, may carry the other," said Carl's
mother.</p>

<p>It was two days after the school holiday,
and again the village was astir before sunrise.
There was a great jingling of cow-bells as the
men and boys moved about from farm to farm
and gathered the cattle together.</p>

<p>Rudolf was to take all the cows in the village
to the mountain pastures for the summer.
Carl and his friend Franz would help him in
taking care of them. Carl's mother would
make the cheese. In the autumn, they would
bring the cows back and divide the cheese according
to the number of cows each family
owned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a joyful time and well deserving a
holiday. Almost every one in the village
would keep the herder and his family company
on his way up the mountainside. Their
food and cooking dishes must be carried; the
cows must be kept in the right path, while
their friends, who were leaving them for
months, must be cheered and kept in good
heart.</p>

<p>At last everything was made ready. Brown
Katze, the handsomest cow in the village, led
the line. She tossed her head as though she
could already sniff the fresh air of the uplands.
How the bells jingled! What gay songs rang
out! Carl was a fine singer himself, and if
you listened you could hear his voice above all
the rest.</p>

<p>The procession at first followed a narrow
path through the woods. There were many
beech and chestnut trees where Carl would go
nutting in the fall. After a while these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
left behind, and evergreens were the only trees
to be seen.</p>

<p>It was already growing cooler and the cows
pushed onward. They seemed to know of
the pleasure before them,&mdash;the sweet grass
and herbs which they would soon be able to
eat to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Ah! the woods came to an end at last, and
the beautiful pastures were reached. There is
nothing in the world like them. It is no wonder
that the cheeses made here are noted all
over the world.</p>

<p>Here were thousands of the lovely Alpine
roses, royal red-purple in colour. Here too,
harebells, violets, and pansies were growing
wild. It was difficult to walk without stepping
on some delicate, beautiful flower.</p>

<p>The party followed a narrow path through
the meadow. They soon came to the little
cottage where Carl would pass the summer.
The building was broad and low, and had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
wide, overhanging roof on which great rocks
were lying, here and there. They were needed
to keep it from blowing off during the hard
storms of the winter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i039.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="Girl with chalet in background" />
<div class="caption">THE CHALET.</div>
</div>

<p>Carl's father opened the door and looked
carefully around to see if everything had
remained safe since the summer before. Yes,
it was all right; no one would know from the
appearance that people had not been inside
the room for eight months at least.</p>

<p>There was the stove over which the milk
would be heated before it could be made into
cheese. The rough table stood in the corner,
while at the farther end was a supply of hay to
be used in case the cattle had need of it.</p>

<p>It was a large room, but there were many
low windows, so it would be bright and cheerful
when the shutters had been taken down.
Just back of this room was the stable, where
the cows could find shelter at night.</p>

<p>Shouldn't you think Carl would be lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
here? No other houses could be seen, no
matter in what direction he turned. He might
not look upon any human faces except those
of Franz and his father and mother for days at
a time. In whatever way he might turn, his
eyes would meet mountains,&mdash;mountains
everywhere. But he loved to be here; he
loved these mountains with all his heart.
They gave him a feeling of freedom and of
strength, and he would often say to himself:</p>

<p>"Ah! the good God has given us a wonderful
world to live in, and we are a part of it all."</p>

<p>Day after day of the short summer Carl and
Franz would drive the cows higher and higher
in search of new feeding-grounds. At last they
would come to the bare, brown rocks near the
summit, and they would know that the season's
work was nearly over.</p>

<p>The villagers who had come with the family
had a picnic dinner at the chalet, as the Swiss
call a mountain cottage like Carl's. Then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
few songs were sung with a hearty good-will.
The time passed so quickly that the people
came near forgetting how late it was growing
when one of the party, standing in the doorway,
heard the clock strike four.</p>

<p>"Good friends, we must start homeward at
once," he cried. "Think of the long climb
down and the dark path through the woods."</p>

<p>What a bustle and commotion there was
now! What hearty hand-shakings were given!
Then away they went, calling back from time
to time, or blowing another farewell upon their
horns when they were hidden from sight by
the trees below.</p>

<p>Carl and Franz turned to help Rudolf in
the care of the cows, for the milking must be
done before nightfall. Carl's mother made up
fresh beds from the hay and put away the provisions.
She would soon have plenty to do
besides, for the cheese-making would be her
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Carl," she said to her boy that night,
"you will be old enough to be a herder yourself
before long. In four or five years you
and Franz can bring the cows here to pasture
by yourselves, and do all the work, too. You
must learn how to make cheese this summer."</p>

<p>So it was that the two boys took their first
lessons, and before many days they had become
good helpers inside the house as well as
outdoors.</p>

<p>They would lift the great kettles of milk
and place them over the fire to heat. At just
the right moment, the rennet must be put in
to curdle the milk and separate the curds from
the whey. Now for the beating with a clean
pine stick. Carl's strong arms could aid his
mother well in this work, upon which the
goodness of the cheese depended.</p>

<p>"Well done," the herder's wife would say.
"It is easy enough to make cheese with two
such good lads to help me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>She was very fond of Franz, and loved him
like a son. The faces of both boys grew
bright when they were praised like this, and
they were all the more eager to work. There
was plenty to do yet, for the boiling and pressing
must come next.</p>

<p>At last a big mould was ready to set away;
but even now it must be watched and turned,
day after day.</p>

<p>Carl's mother proudly watched her store
grow larger as the weeks passed by. Those
cheeses would bring large sums of money,&mdash;at
least, it seemed so to her. But, of course,
the money would be divided among the different
families, according to the number of
cows each sent to the pasture.</p>

<p>One morning as Carl was watching the herd,
he looked down the mountainside and saw
a party of strangers coming up the winding
path. Then he heard a voice call:</p>

<p>"Hullo, hullo, little boy! Is your home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
near by? And can we get a little something
to eat? We are very hungry."</p>

<p>It was a gentleman who spoke these words.
A lady and a little girl about ten years old
were with him. They looked like Americans.
Carl had seen many strangers from other
lands, and he said to himself:</p>

<p>"Yes, they must be Americans."</p>

<p>The little girl was very pretty, and she gave
Carl a sweet smile when he ran to help her
up over a rough place.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'm sure my mother will welcome
you," said our little Swiss cousin. "There
she is, now." And he pointed to the cottage
a short way off, where his mother sat knitting
in the doorway.</p>

<p>When Carl went home to dinner an hour
afterward, he found the strangers still there.
They had lunched on bread and cheese and
the rich sweet milk, and they declared they
had never tasted anything nicer in their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my!" said the little girl, "I believe
I was never so hungry in my life before."</p>

<p>"Carl," she went on, for his mother had
told her his name, "do you ever carve little
houses to look like this one? If you do, I
will ask my father to buy one. He told me
that Swiss boys do carve all sorts of things."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," answered Carl, "but I never
did work of that kind. Over to the west of
us are villages where every one carves. The
men do so as well as the boys. One family
will make the toy houses all their lives; another
will carve chamois and nothing else;
still another will cut out toy cows. But we
in our village have other work."</p>

<p>"But why don't the wood-carvers change?
I should think they would get tired of always
doing the same thing," said Ruth, for this was
the child's name.</p>

<p>"I suppose they never think about it. It
is hard work living among these mountains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
ours. People wish to earn all they can, and
if one makes the same kind of thing, over and
over again, he learns how to do it very
quickly."</p>

<p>"I understand now," answered Ruth.
"And I see, too, why the Swiss have such
a queer way of making watches. One man
in a village keeps making one part of the
works; another man works steadily, year after
year, on another part, and so on. All these
different parts are sent to the factory in the
city, and quickly put together into complete
watches. That is what my father told me,
and he must know, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the work of the people around
Geneva," answered Carl. "I have never been
to that city yet, but I hope to go there before
long."</p>

<p>"We stayed there a week. Nearly every
one I met spoke in French, while you talk
German all the time, Carl. That seems so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
queer. You live in the same country, and yet
you speak in different languages. Why, father
says we shall soon visit another part of Switzerland
where I shall hear nothing but Italian."</p>

<p>"I suppose it must seem strange to you,"
replied Carl, thoughtfully, "yet we all love our
country, and each other. We would fight
promptly to save Switzerland, or to help any
part in time of danger. We even have different
religious beliefs; but while we of our village
are Catholics, and try to do as the good
priests tell us, there are many others not far
away who are Protestants. Yet we are at
peace with one another. Oh, I believe our
country is the freest and best in all the world.
Excuse me, please; I can't help thinking so."</p>

<p>Ruth laughed. "I like you all the better,
Carl, for feeling in this way. Of course, I
love America the best, and shall be glad to
get home again after we have travelled awhile
longer. But I think your country is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
beautiful I have ever seen. And father says
we Americans can learn some good lessons
from Switzerland. I shall understand more
about that, however, when I am older."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here in Switzerland?"
Carl asked.</p>

<p>"It is two months, I think. But we haven't
been travelling all the time. Mother wasn't
well and we stayed most of the time at the
queerest place I ever heard of. This was so
mother could drink the waters and get cured."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the name of the place?"
asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is called the Leuken Baths."</p>

<p>"I've often heard of those waters. They
are boiling as they come bursting out of the
ground, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but that is not the odd part of it, because
there are many other boiling springs in
the world. It is the way that people are cured
at these baths that made me laugh. Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Carl, some of them stay in the water <em>all day
long</em>! They wear flannel gowns and sit soaking
while they play games on floating tables,
and even eat their dinners there. The men
smoke, while the women laugh and chat. The
hot water brings out a rash all over the body,
and the blood, after a while, becomes purer."</p>

<p>Carl laughed when he pictured the food on
floating tables and people sitting around them
with only heads and shoulders out of water.</p>

<p>"Did your mother do like these others?"
he asked, and he turned his head toward the
beautifully dressed lady who sat talking with
his parents.</p>

<p>"No, she said that was too much, but she
drank a good deal of the water, and she feels
better than she has for years," replied Ruth.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear, we have stayed a
long time. I fear we have kept these good
people from their work. We must thank
them, and go back to the town."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Ruth's father who said these words.
He was standing in the doorway, and ready to
start.</p>

<p>"I shall not forget you, Carl," said the
little girl. "I shall often think of this little
cottage up on the mountain, with the pretty
flowers growing around it and the cows feeding
near by."</p>

<p>After they had gone, Carl hastily picked a
bunch of Alpine roses.</p>

<p>"She thought they were beautiful," he said
to himself. "Perhaps she will press one of
them, and keep it to remember me by."</p>

<p>Then with strong bounds and leaps the little
boy overtook the party before they had gone
very far. When he reached them, however,
he was suddenly overcome with shyness. He
hastily put the flowers into the hands of Ruth's
mother, and was far away again before she
could thank him.</p>

<p>"He is a dear little fellow," said the lady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"He will make a strong man, and a good one,
too, I believe. We will always keep these
beautiful flowers. Perhaps we may come here
again in a year or two, Ruth. Then we can
tell Carl how much we thought of his little
gift."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SCHOOLMASTER'S VISIT</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Good</span> news! good news!" cried Carl, as
he came running into the house, quite out of
breath.</p>

<p>"The schoolmaster is coming, mother. I
know it must be he. Come, Franz, let's go to
meet him."</p>

<p>The sun was just hiding his head behind the
mountain-tops, and the little family were about
to sit down to their evening meal.</p>

<p>"Do go at once, my dear boys," said Carl's
mother. "Tell the good teacher how glad we
are at his coming."</p>

<p>It was not a complete surprise, for the
schoolmaster had promised Carl to spend a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
week with him on the mountain pastures, if
it were possible.</p>

<p>Another place was quickly set at the table.
In a few minutes the boys returned, and with
them was a man with a kind face and a hearty
voice.</p>

<p>"Welcome, welcome! my friend," said
Rudolf. "It is indeed a pleasure to see you
here. What news is there from the good folks
of our village?"</p>

<p>"They are all well, and send greetings.
Even poor little Gretel, the cretin, seemed to
understand where I was coming, and she sent
you her love."</p>

<p>What is a cretin, you wonder? A person
of weak mind is so called in Switzerland. You
often find such people who are not as bright
as they should be. The mind is dull and
dark, it cannot see and understand like others.</p>

<p>Why is it that cretins are often found in the
homes of the poor? Some think it is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the Swiss are such hard workers, and yet do
not have the nourishing food they should.</p>

<p>"Have you been at home all summer?"
asked Rudolf.</p>

<p>"No, I had business that took me over the
St. Bernard Pass. It was a hard journey, even
in this summer-time, for I travelled most of
the way on foot."</p>

<p>"O, how I wish I could have gone with
you," cried Franz. "I have always longed
to visit the good monks and see their brave
dogs."</p>

<p>"It must be a terrible tramp over the
mountain in winter," the schoolmaster went
on. "Yet every year there are some people
who need to go that way at that season. How
much worse it would be, however, if the
monastery were not there, with the priests
living in it and giving their lives to help
others."</p>

<p>"They say that the cold is so great that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
monks cannot stand more than a few years of
such a life," said Rudolf.</p>

<p>"It is true," replied the schoolmaster.
"Many of them die before their time, while
others must after a while go down to warmer
lands. The noble dogs that they raise stand
the cold much better."</p>

<p>"I have often made a picture for myself of
a snow-storm on the St. Bernard," said Carl,
thoughtfully. He had not spoken for a long
time. "How the drifts pile up and fill the
pathway. The snow falls thick and fast, and
after a while the poor traveller cannot tell
which way to turn. He grows cold and numb;
he is quite tired out. At last he gives up hope,
and perhaps he sinks down, and perhaps he
loses all sense of where he is. Now is the
very time that the good monks, watching
the storm, loose the dogs. But first, food
and reviving drink are fastened to the collars
of the trusty animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Off they bound, down the mountainside,
scenting the air on every side. They understand
their duty and work faithfully. They
find the poor traveller in time to save his life
and guide him to the home of the priests.
Ah! how I love these good men and their
faithful dogs."</p>

<p>"Your cheeks have grown quite rosy with
the story, my boy," said the schoolmaster.
"The picture in your mind must be bright,
indeed. But we cannot praise too highly both
the monks and their loving deeds. Sometimes,
alas! the dogs do not find the travellers
in time, however. Then they can only drag
their dead bodies to the monastery, where they
will stay till friends of the travellers come to
claim them. But enough of this sad thought
for to-night; let us talk of other things."</p>

<p>"Dear master," said Franz, "please tell us
of other things you have seen this summer.
We always love to hear your stories."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see. O, yes, now I think of
something that will interest you boys. I
travelled for quite a distance with a hunter.
He had been in search of chamois, but he
says they are getting very scarce now. He
was bringing home only one."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="Goat following boy" />
<div class="caption">"'FOLLOWING ITS MASTER ABOUT JUST LIKE A DOG.'"</div>
</div>

<p>"It seems a shame to kill the poor creatures,"
said Carl's father. "They are gentle
and harmless, and take pleasure in living
where others find only danger. Once I came
suddenly upon a herd of them. They seemed
to be having a game of chase together, and
were frolicking gaily. But at the sound of
my footstep they fled like the wind over the
snow and ice. In a moment, almost, they
were out of sight."</p>

<p>"Why can they climb where no one else is
able to go?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Behind each hoof there is another called
the false hoof," replied the schoolmaster. "I
looked at those of the dead chamois the hunter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was carrying home. These extra hoofs give the
creature the power to hold himself in places
which would not be safe without their aid.
Their bodies are very light and their legs are
slim, while they seem to be entirely without
fear of anything save men."</p>

<p>"Poor little things," exclaimed Franz.
"We are taught to be kind to the birds
and to protect them in every way. I never
in my life knew of a Swiss harming a bird's
nest. We ought to be kind to the chamois as
well. I once knew a boy who had a tame one
for a pet. His father caught it when it was
very young. It was the dearest little thing,
following its master about just like a dog. In
summer its hair was yellowish brown, but in
winter it grew darker and was almost black."</p>

<p>"Did you know that the chamois always
have a sentinel on guard while they are feeding?"
asked the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said both boys together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is true, the hunters have told me
so. If this chamois guard hears the slightest
sound or discovers even a footprint, he at once
gives an alarm. Away flees the herd in search
of safety.</p>

<p>"But, dear me! it is growing late and you
must be up early in the morning. Then you
must show me your store of cheeses," he
added, turning to Carl's mother. "The cows
are looking fine; they must enjoy the pastures
here. And now, good night. May you all
sleep well in the care of the loving Father."</p>

<p>In a few minutes every one in the little
cottage was resting quietly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BRAVE ARCHER</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright summer day. In the morning
Carl's father had said to the boys:</p>

<p>"You may have a holiday and may go
where you please with the schoolmaster. I
will attend to the cows all the day."</p>

<p>So they had taken a lunch and had climbed
to the summit of the mountain. Their kind
teacher had told them stories of the flowers
and the stones.</p>

<p>"They never seemed so much alive to me
before," said Carl, as they sat resting on a big
gray rock, far up above the pastures. "I like
to hear you talk in school, dear master, but it
is far better up here among the grand mountains
and in the fresh air. Perhaps William
Tell himself once stood on this very spot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is quite likely," replied the schoolmaster.
"You know that his home was not
many miles from our village. He was never
so happy as when wandering among the mountains.
Those were wonderful times in which
he lived. But there is the same feeling now as
then. We Swiss love freedom best of all, and
are ever ready to give our lives for it, if there
be need."</p>

<p>"How cruel the Austrians were! They
thought that because theirs was a large and
powerful country they could do with us as they
pleased. But they found themselves mistaken
after awhile, didn't they?" said Franz.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, but never forget that our
freedom started in the work of <em>three</em> men, and
three only, who joined together with brave
hearts. They worked with no selfish feeling,
and, before the end came, they had filled all
Switzerland with the daring to be free."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we will always remember that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
And only think! one of those three men lived
here in our Canton. I am always proud to
think of it."</p>

<p>"Boys, look at our country now, and then
turn back to the sad times long ago. Can
you imagine the way those three men felt
when they met in the dark night on the field
of Rütli? Can you not see them pledging
themselves to their country in throwing off
the yoke of Austria?</p>

<p>"They hated their rulers so much that a
peacock was not allowed to live in Switzerland.
That was, you know, because a peacock
feather was the emblem of Austria."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it about that time that William
Tell lived?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he was known through all the
country as a brave man and a skilful archer.
It was very natural that he should refuse to
show honour to the Austrian governor."</p>

<p>"It makes me angry whenever I think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Gessler," cried Franz. "It seems to me only
another name for cruel power. But is it possible
that he really had his hat stuck up on a
pole in the market-place of Altdorf, and that
every Swiss who passed by was ordered to
bow down before it?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, although some people think
the whole story of William Tell is only a
legend, and that is a part of it. Our history
shows, however, that this brave man really
lived."</p>

<p>"Won't you repeat the story?" asked
Franz. "I love to hear it over and over
again."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like."</p>

<p>"After Gessler's hat had been stuck on the
pole, William Tell was one of those who
passed by. Bow before the hat of the cruel
tyrant! It was not to be thought of. Tell
took no notice of it whatever. He did not
appear to know it was there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now it happened that one of Gessler's
spies stood near by. He watched Tell closely.
He sent word to his master at once that there
was one Swiss who would not give him proper
honour. You know what followed, my boys.
Tell was seized and bound.</p>

<p>"Gessler must have said to himself, 'I will
make an example of this insolent peasant.'
For Tell was brought before him and ordered
to stand at a great distance from his little son
and shoot at an apple on the boy's head. If
he struck the apple he was to be allowed to go
free.</p>

<p>"Do you think Tell feared he could not
do it? No, he was too good an archer. But
his child was so dear to him that his very love
might make his hand tremble. Think again!
the boy might move from fright, and then
the arrow would enter his body instead of
the apple on his head.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible thing to think of. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
William Tell made ready for the trial. The
time came. A crowd of people gathered to
see the test. The boy did not move a muscle.
The arrow went straight to its mark.
The people shouted with joy.</p>

<p>"Then it was that Gessler, who had been
watching closely, noticed that Tell held a
second arrow.</p>

<p>"'Why didst thou bring more than one,
thou proud peasant?' angrily asked the
tyrant.</p>

<p>"'That I might shoot thee had I failed in
cleaving the apple,' was the quick answer.</p>

<p>"'Seize him! Bind him hand and foot, and
away with him to the dungeon!' shouted the
enraged governor.</p>

<p>"His men seized Tell, and strong chains
made the noble Swiss helpless. He was carried
to a boat already waiting on the shore,
for the dungeon was across the deep, blue
waters of Lake Lucerne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! how sad must have been the hearts
of our people as they watched Gessler and his
servants get into the boat and row away.
They thought they would never see the brave
archer again.</p>

<p>"But this was not God's will. A sudden
storm arose before the party had gone very
far. The wind blew fearfully, and the little
boat was tossed about on the waves as though
it were a feather. The rowers could not keep
the boat in her course. It seemed as though,
every moment, she would be dashed against
the rocks and destroyed. Then it was that
Gessler remembered that Tell was as skilful
with a boat as he was with a bow and
arrow.</p>

<p>"'Take off the peasant's chains,' he cried.
'Let him guide us to a safe landing-place. It
is our only chance of being saved.'</p>

<p>"Tell was made free. His quick mind told
him what to do. He seized the oars, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with strong strokes soon brought the boat
close to the shore. Then, springing out, he
pushed the boat off into the water.</p>

<p>"Would Gessler be saved? Tell wondered
if it were possible. Then he said to himself,
'If the tyrant is not destroyed, he must go
home through the pass in the mountains.'</p>

<p>"With this thought, he hurried up over the
crags, and hid himself behind a great rock.
He waited patiently. At last he heard footsteps
and voices. His enemy was drawing
near. He stood ready with bent bow. As
Gessler came into view, whizz! flew the arrow
straight into the tyrant's heart! He could
never again harm Switzerland or the Swiss."</p>

<p>"Brave Tell! Brave Tell!" shouted Carl.
"Dear master, have you ever visited the
chapel which stands to-day in honour of this
great countryman of ours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Carl, and when you come back to the
lowlands in the fall, you shall visit it with me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
You and Franz must also go to look at the
stone on which Tell stepped as he sprang
from Gessler's boat. Even now, we can seem
to feel Tell's joy when he wandered among
the mountains, and thought of plans by which
he could help his country. For after Gessler
was killed, there was the whole army of Austria
to be driven out."</p>

<p>"People needn't tell me that the story of
William Tell and the apple is only a legend,"
exclaimed Franz. "I believe every word of
it, don't you, Carl?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do. Won't you tell us another
story? Look! the sun is still high in the sky.
We need not go home for an hour yet."</p>

<p>"Let me see, boys. Shall it be a tale of
old Switzerland and of her struggles with her
enemies?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried both boys. "We are
never tired of hearing of the lives of our great
men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, then, you shall listen to the
story of Arnold of Winkelried.</p>

<p>"It was a time of great danger. The Austrians
were pouring into our country. Their soldiers,
protected by the strongest steel armour,
bore fearful weapons. Our people were poor,
and had only slings or bows and arrows with
which to defend themselves. What should be
done? There was the Austrian army, closely
drawn up, with shields glistening in the sunlight,&mdash;here
were the Swiss, few and unprotected,
but burning with love for their
country.</p>

<p>"It seemed as though all chance of saving
Switzerland was hopeless. Then the brave
Arnold spoke.</p>

<p>"'Friends,' said he, 'I am ready to give my
life for my country. I will rush into the ranks
of our enemies and make an entrance for you.
Be ready; follow with all your might, and you
may throw them into confusion. You who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
live after me must take care of my wife and
children when I am gone.'</p>

<p>"There was not a moment to be lost.</p>

<p>"'Make way for Liberty!' cried Arnold,
then ran with arms extended wide, as if to
clasp his dearest friend.</p>

<p>"A hundred spears were thrust toward him.
He gathered as many as he could in his hands
and arms. They entered his body on all sides,
but before the hero fell he had made an opening
into the ranks of the enemy through which
his comrades dashed. Thrown into confusion,
the Austrians fled, and were driven out of our
loved country.</p>

<p>"Switzerland was saved for us, my lads,
through the sacrifice of that noble man, Arnold
von Winkelried. May you live to do him
honour!"</p>

<p>"I can see him now, as he rushed into the
midst of the cruel Austrians," cried Carl, jumping
to his feet. "Noble, noble Arnold! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
do not believe any other land has such a hero.
Dear master, I will try to be braver and truer
all my life, and be ready to serve my country
faithfully in time of need."</p>

<p>"I, too," exclaimed Franz, "will be more
of a man from this very moment."</p>

<p>"Well said, my dear boys. But come, it is
growing late and you will be needed at home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HAYMAKERS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mother!</span> mother! here come the mowers,"
called Carl, as he came toward the house
with a pail of milk in each hand. The wooden
milking-stool was still strapped around the
boy's waist, and its one leg stuck out behind
like a little stiff tail. You would have laughed
at the sight, as did the two haymakers who
had by this time reached the hut.</p>

<p>"What, ho! Carl," said one of the men,
"are you changing into a monkey now you
have come up to the highlands for the
summer?"</p>

<p>"I was so busy thinking," replied the boy,
"that I forgot to leave the stool in the stable
when I had finished the milking. I am glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
you are here to-night. How does the work
go?"</p>

<p>"Pretty hard, my boy, pretty hard, but
I love it," answered the younger man of the
two mowers. "Still, I shouldn't advise you
to be a haymaker when you grow up. It is
too dangerous a business."</p>

<p>"It isn't such hard work gathering the hay
in these parts as it is in most places," said the
older man. "Ah! many a time I have
worked all day long on the edge of a precipice;
it is a wonder I am living now."</p>

<p>"It is not strange that the law allows only
one person in a family to be a haymaker," said
Carl's mother, who had come to the door to
welcome her visitors. "I am very glad my
husband never chose the work. I should fret
about him all through the summer. But come
in, friends, and lay down your scythes. We
are glad to see you."</p>

<p>The two mowers were on their way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
higher places up on the mountain. They
were cutting the wild hay which could be
found here and there in little patches among
the rocks and cliffs.</p>

<p>Could this work be worth while? We
wonder if it is possible. But the Swiss value
the mountain hay greatly. It is sweet and
tender and full of fine herbs, while the higher
it grows, the better it is. The cattle have a
treat in the winter-time when they have
a dinner of this wild mountain hay.</p>

<p>Carl's friends had large nets tied up in
bundles and fastened to their backs. Their
shoes had iron spikes in the strong soles.
These would keep their feet from slipping, as
they reached down over the edge of a sharp
cliff or held themselves on some steep slope
while they skilfully gathered the hay and put
it in the nets. But, even then, they must not
make a false step or grow dizzy, or let fear
enter their heads. If any of these things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
should happen, an accident, and probably a
very bad one, too, would surely follow.</p>

<p>When all the nets were filled, they would
be stored in safe nooks until the snow should
come. Then for the sport! For the mowers
would climb the mountains with their sledges,
load them with the nets full of hay, and slide
down the slopes with their precious stores.</p>

<p>"May I go with you when you collect the
hay in November?" Carl asked his friends.
"I won't be afraid, and it is such fun travelling
like the wind."</p>

<p>"It will take your breath away, I promise
you," said the boy's father. He had come
into the house just in time to hear what was
being said. "I will risk you, Carl, however.
You would not be afraid, and he who is not
afraid is generally safe. It is fear that causes
most of the accidents. But come, my good
wife has made the supper ready. Let us sit
down; then we can go on talking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"How good this is!" said one of the
visitors, as he tasted the bread on which
toasted cheese had been spread.</p>

<p>Carl's mother did not sit down to the table
with the others. She had said to herself, "I will
give the mowers a treat. They are not able to
have the comforts of a home very often." So
she stood by the fire and held a mould of
cheese close to the flames. As fast as it
softened, she scraped it off and spread it on
the slices of bread. Every one was hungry,
so she was kept busy serving first one, then
another.</p>

<p>She smiled at the men's praise. They told
her they had spent the night before with two
goatherds who lived in a cave. It was only a
few miles away on the west slope of the
mountain.</p>

<p>"They have a fine flock of goats," said one
of the men, "and they are getting quantities
of rich milk for cheese. But it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
good for them to sleep two or three months in
such a wretched place. They look pale, even
though they breathe this fine mountain air all
day long."</p>

<p>"Carl and Franz don't look sickly, by any
means," laughed Rudolf, as he pointed to the
boys' brown arms. The sleeves of their leather
jackets were short and hardly reached to their
elbows. The strong sunshine and wind had
done their work and changed the colour of the
fair skin to a deep brown.</p>

<p>"You will have good weather for haying,
to-morrow," said Franz, who was standing at
the window and looking off toward a mountain-top
in the distance. "Pilatus has his hood on
to-night."</p>

<p>"A good sign, surely," said Rudolf. "We
shall probably see a fine sunrise in the morning.
You all know the old verse,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'If Pilatus wears his hood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Then the weather's always good.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The "hood" is a cloud which spreads out
over the summit of the mountain and hides
it from sight. Carl has often looked for this
the night before a picnic or festival. If he
saw it, he would go to bed happy, for he felt
sure it would be pleasant the next day.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think Pilatus would be happy
with such a name," said Franz. "I wonder
if it is really true that Pilate's body was buried
in the lake up near its summit."</p>

<p>"That is the story I heard when I was a
little boy at my mother's knee," said the old
hay-cutter. "I have heard it many times
since. It may be only a legend, but it seems
true to me, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Tell it to us again," said Rudolf. "There
are no stories like the ones we heard in our
childhood."</p>

<p>"It was after the death of our Master,"
said the mower, in a low, sad voice. "Pilate
saw too late what he had done. He had allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the Wise One to be put to death. He
himself was to blame, for he could have saved
Him. He could not put the thought out of
his mind. At last, he could bear it no longer,
and he ended his own life.</p>

<p>"His body was thrown into the Tiber, a
river that flows by the city of Rome. The
river refused to let it stay there, for it was the
body of too wicked a man, so it cast it up on
the shore. Then it was carried to the Rhine,
but this river would not keep it, either.
What should be tried now? Some one said,
'We will take it to the summit of a mountain
where there is a deep lake, and drop it in the
dark waters.'</p>

<p>"It was done, and the body found a resting-place
at last."</p>

<p>"You did not finish the story," said Rudolf.
"It is said that the restless spirit of Pilate is
allowed to arise once each year and roam
through the mountains for a single night on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
a jet-black horse. On that night the waters
of the lake surge and foam as if a terrible
storm were raging."</p>

<p>"Are you going to the party to-morrow
night?" asked the younger mower. "The
goatherds told me about it. I wish we could
be there, but our work is too far away.
The villagers are getting ready for a good
time."</p>

<p>"What party?" cried Carl and Franz
together. They were excited at the very
idea.</p>

<p>"Why, haven't you heard about it? You
know there is a little village about two miles
below the pasture where those goatherds live.
The young folks have planned to have a dance
and a wrestling match. I am surprised you
have not heard about it. They expect all the
herders and mowers to come from near and
far. You will certainly be invited in the
morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it was. Before the cows were let
out to pasture, a horn was heard in the distance.</p>

<p>"Hail, friends!" it seemed to call.</p>

<p>Carl rushed into the house for his own horn
and gave a strong, clear blast, then another
and another. It was an answering cry of welcome
and good-will.</p>

<p>A boy about twelve years old soon came
into view. He wore a tight-fitting leather cap
and heavy shoes with iron-spiked soles like
Carl's. He came hurrying along.</p>

<p>"There is to be a party at our village to-night,"
he said, as soon as he was near enough
for Carl to hear. "It will be moonlight, you
know, and we will have a jolly time. All
your folks must come, too."</p>

<p>Carl and Franz were soon talking with the
boy as though they had always known him,
yet they had never met before.</p>

<p>"My folks came near forgetting there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
any one living here this summer," the strange
boy said. "They only thought about it last
night, but they very much wish you to come."</p>

<p>He stayed only a few moments, as he had
been told to return at once.</p>

<p>"There is plenty to do, you know, to get
ready for a party," he said. "Besides, it will
take me a good hour to go back by the shortest
path around the slope, it winds up and
down so much. But you will come, won't
you?"</p>

<p>Carl's father and mother were as much
pleased by the invitation as were the boys.
The milking was done earlier than usual, and
the cows were locked up in the stable before
the sunset light had coloured the snowy tops
of the distant mountains.</p>

<p>It was quite a long tramp for Carl's mother,
but she only thought how nice it would be to
join in dance and song again. The wrestling
match took place in the afternoon. The father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
would not have missed that for a good deal,
so he left home three hours, at least, before
the others. The boys stayed behind to help
the mother in the milking and to show her the
way to the village afterward.</p>

<p>The party was a merry one. They drank
cup after cup of coffee, and all the good old
songs of Switzerland were sung with a will.
Carl's mother showed she had not forgotten
how to dance. Carl and Franz were too shy
to join in the dancing, but it was fun enough
for them to watch the others. Oh, yes, it was
a merry time, and the moon shone so brightly
that it lighted the path homeward almost as
plainly as though it were daytime.</p>

<p>"Next week we return to our own little village
in the valley," said Rudolf, as the family
walked back after the party. "Our old
friends will be glad to see us as well as the
fine store of cheese we shall bring. Then for
another merrymaking. Carl, you must show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
us then what you learned at the gymnasium
last year."</p>

<p>The boy's father was proud of Carl's
strength and grace. "How fine it is," he
often said to himself, "that every school in
our country has a gymnasium, so that the
boys are trained in body as well as in mind.
That is the way to have strong men to defend
our country and to govern it. I will buy Carl
a rifle for his very own. The boy deserves it,
he has worked so hard and so well all summer.
He can shoot well already, and I will train
him myself this winter, and in a year or two
more he can take part in the yearly rifle match.
I am very glad I have a son."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MARMOT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the week after Carl got back to the
village. What a busy day it had been for his
mother! You would certainly think so if you
had looked at the wide field back of the house.
A great part of it was covered with the family
wash. Sheets, sheets, sheets! And piece after
piece of clothing! What could it all mean?</p>

<p>And did this little family own so much linen
as lay spread out on the grass to-day? It was
indeed so. In Carl's village it is the custom
to wash only twice a year. Of course, chests
full of bedding are needed to last six months,
if the pieces are changed as often in Switzerland
as they are in our country.</p>

<p>When Carl's mother was married, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
brought enough linen to her new home to last
for the rest of her life. Carl's grandmother had
been busy for years getting it ready for her
daughter. A Swiss woman would feel ashamed
if she did not have a large quantity of such
things with which to begin housekeeping.</p>

<p>When the washing had been spread out on
the grass, Carl's mother went into the house
feeling quite tired from her day's work. The
two women who had been helping her had
gone home. She sat down in a chair to rest
herself, and closed her eyes. Just then she
heard steps outside.</p>

<p>"It is Carl getting home from school," she
thought, and she did not look up, even when
the door opened.</p>

<p>"Well, wife, we have caught you sleeping,
while it is still day. Wake up, and see who
has come to visit us."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, and there stood not
only her husband and Carl, but a dear brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
whom she had not seen for years. How delighted
she was! He had changed from a slim
young fellow into a big, strong man.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i091.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="boy tied by a rope to a man, both climbing rocks of Matterhorn" />
<div class="caption">CLIMBING THE MATTERHORN.</div>
</div>

<p>"O, Fritz, how glad I am to see you," she
cried. "Do tell us about all that has happened.
We have not heard from you for a
long time. What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"I have spent part of my time as a guide
among the highest mountains of the Alps.
There is not much work of that kind to do
around here; the passes are not dangerous,
you know. Most of the travellers who come
to this part of Switzerland are satisfied if they
go up the Rigi in a train. But I have taken
many dangerous trips in other parts of the
country, and been well paid for them."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been up the Matterhorn?"
asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Only once, my boy. It was the most
fearful experience of my whole life. I shudder
when I think of it. There was a party of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
three gentlemen besides another guide and myself.
You know it is the shape of that mountain
that makes it so dangerous to climb. It
reaches up toward the heavens like a great icy
wedge.</p>

<p>"Of course, we had a long, stout rope to
pass from one to another. It was fastened
around the waist of each of us, as soon as we
reached the difficult part. Our shoes had iron
spikes in the soles to help us still more, while
each one carried a stout, iron-shod staff. The
other guide and myself had hatchets to use in
cutting steps when we came to a smooth slope
of ice.</p>

<p>"Think of it, as we sit here in this cozy,
comfortable room. There were several times
that I was lowered over a steep, ice-covered
ridge by a rope. And while I hung there, I
had to cut out steps with my hatchet.</p>

<p>"There was many a time, too, that only one
of us dared to move at a time. In case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
footing was not safe, the others could pull him
back if he made a misstep and fell."</p>

<p>"Did you climb that dangerous mountain
in one day?" asked Rudolf. "I thought it
was impossible."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. We went the greater
part of the distance the first day, and then
camped out for the night. Early the next
morning we rose to finish the fearful undertaking.
And we did succeed, but I would
never attempt it again for all the money in
the world."</p>

<p>"O, Fritz, how did you feel when you
had reached the summit?" asked Carl's
mother.</p>

<p>"In the first place, I was terribly cold. My
heart was beating so rapidly I could scarcely
think. It was not from fear, though. It was
because the air was so thin that it made the
blood rush rapidly through the lungs to get
enough of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I can never forget the sight that was
before us. Everything we had ever known
seemed so little now, it was so far below us.
Towns, lakes, and rivers were tiny dots or
lines, while we could look across the summits
of other snow-capped peaks."</p>

<p>"Was it easy coming down?" asked Carl,
"that is, of course, did it seem easy beside the
upward climb?"</p>

<p>"I believe the descent was more terrible, my
boy. It was hard to keep from growing dizzy,
and it would have been so easy to make a false
step and slide over some cliff and fall thousands
of feet. I couldn't keep out of my
mind the story of the first party who climbed
to the summit of the Matterhorn."</p>

<p>"I do not wonder, my dear brother, the
whole world sorrowed over their fate," said
Carl's mother. "Only think of their pride at
succeeding, and then of the horrible death of
four of the party."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do tell us about it; I never heard the
story," said Carl.</p>

<p>"A brave man named Whymper was determined
to climb the mountain," answered his
father. "Every one else had failed. He said
to himself: 'I will not give up. I will keep
trying even if the storms and clouds and
ice-walls drive me back again and again.'</p>

<p>"He kept on trying, but each time with no
success. At last Whymper formed a party
with three Englishmen. They hired the
trustiest guides known in the country, besides
two men to carry the tents and provisions.
After great trouble they reached the summit
and planted a flag there to tell the story of
their coming.</p>

<p>"But on their way down one of the
Englishmen slipped. He struck the guide
as he fell and the two men hung over the
precipice. They were fastened to the others
by the rope; surely they could be saved!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
But, alas! the rope broke under the sudden
weight. Not only those men, but two others,
were swept down four thousand feet!</p>

<p>"The others who were left were filled with
such horror they could not move for a long
while. Their skilful guide had been killed;
could they descend the mountain safely now?
It looked impossible; they were dizzy and
faint. It seemed as though there were only
one thing left: they would have to stay where
they were till death should come.</p>

<p>"After a while, however, their courage returned
and they succeeded in reaching the
foot of the mountain at last without any
other accident, but with a sad and fearful
story to tell of those who started out with
them."</p>

<p>"I should think we would have heard of
your climbing the Matterhorn, Fritz," said
Rudolf. "It was a great thing to do, and few
have dared it. We are proud of you, indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
How would you have liked to be in your
uncle's place, Carl?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could have been with him, father.
When I am older, I hope I may have a chance
to do such daring deeds. I'll be glad to try,
anyway."</p>

<p>Carl's mother shivered, as she quickly said:</p>

<p>"There are other kinds of brave deeds, Carl,
which I hope you will be ever ready to do.
Speak the truth and be an honest man in
all things. That kind of bravery in you
will satisfy me. But be willing for your
mother's sake to stay away from icy mountain
peaks."</p>

<p>The loving woman's eyes had filled with
tears. Carl ran to her and put his arms
around her neck.</p>

<p>"Don't fret, my dear mother, I will always
try to do what you wish." And he kissed her
again and again. As he did so, he began
to cough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe Carl has the whooping-cough,"
said his father. "He never had it when he
was little, and every now and then he gives a
regular whoop."</p>

<p>"I wish we had some marmot fat; that
would cure him quickly," said his mother.
"At any rate, it would make him feel
better."</p>

<p>"I have a bottle of the oil in my satchel,"
said his uncle. "It is good for so many things,
I keep it on hand. Here, Carl, open the bag
and take a dose at once. I got it from the fat
of the last marmot I killed."</p>

<p>"O, uncle, I never saw one in my life.
I've heard so much about marmots, I would
rather hear you tell about them than take the
medicine."</p>

<p>"You may have both the medicine and the
story, Carl. While we sit around the stove
this evening you shall hear of the fun I have
had hunting the shy little creature."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Fritz was certainly good company.
He helped Rudolf and Carl in doing the
night's work about the little farm while the
supper was made ready. Two or three of
the neighbours came in after that. They had
heard of Fritz's arrival, and wished to welcome
him. It was a very pleasant evening, for
Fritz was glad to see his old friends and had
much to tell.</p>

<p>Before bedtime came, Carl asked his uncle
to tell about marmot hunting. "You know
you promised me before supper," he said.</p>

<p>"What shall I tell?" laughed Fritz. "You
all know, to begin with, what a shy little creature
it is, and how it passes the winter."</p>

<p>"It lies asleep month after month, doesn't
it?" asked Carl. "The schoolmaster told us
so."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear. It lives high up on the
mountainsides and close to the snow-line.
Of course, the summer season is very short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
there. All through the long winter of six or
eight months the marmot lies in his burrow
and does not move. You would hardly call
it sleep, though. The little creature scarcely
breathes; if you should see him then, you
would think he was dead.</p>

<p>"But as soon as there is warmer weather he
begins to rouse himself. How thin he is now!
At the beginning of winter he was quite fat.
That fat has in some wonderful way kept him
alive through the long months."</p>

<p>"Does he stay in this burrow all alone,
uncle?"</p>

<p>"O, no. Marmots live together in families
in the summer-time, and when the time
comes for a long rest, a whole family enter the
burrow and stretch themselves out close together
on the hay."</p>

<p>"Where does the hay come from?" asked
one of the visitors.</p>

<p>"Why, the marmots carry it into the burrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and line it as carefully as birds prepare
their nests."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said Rudolf, "that one
marmot lies on his back and holds a bundle
of hay between his legs, while two or three
others drag him through the long tunnel into
the burrow. That is the reason the hair is
worn off the backs of so many of them."</p>

<p>Fritz held his sides with laughter.</p>

<p>"Did you believe such a silly story as that,
Rudolf? I thought you knew more about the
animals of our mountains than that, surely.</p>

<p>"When a marmot's back is bare, you may
know it is because the roof of his burrow is
not high enough. His hair has rubbed off
against it as he moved while asleep."</p>

<p>"How large do the marmots grow?" asked
Carl. "Are they pretty creatures, uncle; and
are they clever?"</p>

<p>"They are rather stupid, it seems to me,
Carl, and they are not as pretty as squirrels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
They are larger, however. The colour of
their fur is a yellowish-gray. Their tails are
short, like those of rabbits. They move about
in a slow, clumsy way."</p>

<p>"Why are they so hard to catch, if that is
so?" said Carl's mother.</p>

<p>"While they are feeding, there is always
one of them acting as a guard. He stands
near the opening into the burrow, and gives
a cry of alarm if he hears the slightest strange
sound. Then all the others scamper with him
through the passageway into their home."</p>

<p>"But can't the hunters easily dig it out and
reach them?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the tunnel that leads to the
burrow is many feet long. A friend of mine
unearthed one that was actually thirty feet
from the outside opening of the burrow."</p>

<p>"How did you manage to catch them?
You have killed quite a number, haven't
you?" asked Rudolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have been quite successful, and this
is the way I worked: If I found any tracks
or signs of their burrows, I crept along very
softly. I kept looking ahead in all directions.
Away off in the distance, perhaps, I saw something
looking like a family of marmots asleep
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"I crept nearer and nearer. I must not
make a sound or I would lose my chance.
At last, when I was close upon them, I lifted
a stone and blocked the opening to their
burrow. Then I whistled. The poor little
things waked up too late and saw that their
way home was cut off. They gave a shrill cry,
like a whistle, and fled together into the nearest
cranny. There they cowered while I drew
near and pinned one of them to the ground.
It was an easy matter to end its life after that.</p>

<p>"If I wished to carry it home alive, I seized
it by its hind legs and dropped it into a bag;
the poor little thing was helpless then."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will stay with us for a while, won't
you, Fritz?" asked one of the neighbours.
"You have been a long time away, and have
been living a rough and dangerous life as a
guide. It seems good, indeed, to see you
back again."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall rest here for a month or so
with my good sister and Rudolf. Then I
must be away among my mountains again.
I am never so happy as when I am climbing
some difficult slope."</p>

<p>"It is growing late, friends," said one of the
visitors. "We must bid you good night, for
to-morrow brings its work to each of us."</p>

<p>"Good night, good night, then. But let
us first have a song in memory of old days,"
said Fritz.</p>

<p>All joined with a good-will. Half an hour
afterward the lights were out in the little house
and every one was settled for a good night's
rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GLACIER AND AVALANCHE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was cold weather now. Some snow had
already fallen, and Carl had helped his father
and mother in getting ready for the long, cold
winter.</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz had been gone for quite a while,
and the family had settled down to their old
quiet life. One evening Carl was sitting by
the big stove and telling his mother about the
day's work at school, when the door opened,
and who should stand there but Fritz. Carl
rushed into his arms, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I knew you would come back, because
you promised, Uncle Fritz."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I shall stay only a day or two.
Then I must be off again. There is a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
village up in the mountains about twenty miles
away. I must go there before the weather
grows any colder, for if a big snow-storm
should come up it would make hard walking."</p>

<p>"Will you go all the way on foot, uncle?"
asked Carl. "I do believe you never ride in
a train if you can help it."</p>

<p>Fritz laughed. "I must say I enjoy the
walking best. But, anyhow, this time my way
lies across country. How would you like to
go too? I have to cross a glacier before I
get there. Did you ever see a glacier, my
boy?"</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Fritz, and I have always
longed to do so. O, mother, may I go?
I will study hard at school, and make up all
the lessons I lose while I am away."</p>

<p>"How long will you be gone, Fritz?"
asked his sister.</p>

<p>"Not over three days, if the weather is
good; and after that I shall not stay in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
part of the country. I am going to Geneva,
so it will be Carl's last chance for a long time
to go with me."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i109.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Man and boy looking at river of ice with full moon above" />
<div class="caption">"IT WAS A RIVER OF SOLID ICE!"</div>
</div>

<p>In this way it came to pass that Carl went
with his uncle.</p>

<p>"Do take good care of him, Fritz," the
loving mother called, as the man and boy left
the little cottage the next morning. "You
know he is my only child."</p>

<p>"Never fear, sister. I will watch well, and
try to keep danger away," Fritz promised.</p>

<p>Soon after the two travellers had left the
village, the way became quite rough. Fritz
told many stories of his wild life as a guide,
and Carl was so interested he had no time to
think about himself.</p>

<p>After three hours of hard walking, the two
travellers stopped to rest and eat the lunch of
bread and cheese Carl's mother had given
them. A long tramp was still before them,
and the way grew rougher at every step. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sun was just setting when the little mountain
village at last came in sight.</p>

<p>It looked, at first, like a small bunch of
black dots high up on the steep slope before
them. But before it could be reached, the
glacier must be crossed.</p>

<p>It was a river, indeed, but not like most
other rivers in the world. It was a river of
solid ice! When it first came in sight, it
seemed like a broad, smooth sheet. Carl was
a little bit disappointed. He turned to his
uncle, and said:</p>

<p>"I don't see anything wonderful or dangerous
in a glacier, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Wait till you get a little nearer," was the
answer. "It is not as easy to cross it as it
at first seems."</p>

<p>"Why does it stay a river of ice all the
time, uncle? I should think it would melt
in the summer-time, and be like other rivers,"
Carl went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"High up in the mountains the snow stays
all the year round. You know that?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, Uncle Fritz."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. The mass gets heavier
and heavier, and much of it is gradually
changed into ice."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that, too."</p>

<p>"The great weight makes it begin to slide
down. It comes very slowly, of course,&mdash;so
slowly that it does not seem to move at all.
But it does move, and brings with it rocks
and trees and whatever is in its way."</p>

<p>"I see now why it is called a <em>river</em> of ice,
uncle. But it doesn't move as fast in the
winter as in the summer, does it?"</p>

<p>"O, no, it can hardly be said to move at all
during the coldest months of the year. In the
summer-time, however, it moves much faster
than it seems to do. I have been crossing a
glacier more than once when I was suddenly
startled by a tremendous noise. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
seem like the roar of thunder; but as the sky
was clear, it was certainly not thunder. It
was a sound made by the glacier itself as it
passed over uneven ground. It is very likely
that deep cracks opened in the ice at the same
time, making a noise like an explosion.</p>

<p>"But here we are, my dear, on the edge of
the ice river. Don't you think now that it is
a wonderful sight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. How beautiful the colour
is! It is such a lovely blue. But dear me!
look at this mass of rocks all along the edge.
The glacier is a giant, isn't it, to make these
great stones prisoners and bring them along in
its course? They look strong and ugly, yet
they are helpless in its clutches. It isn't easy
walking over them, either, is it?"</p>

<p>After some hard climbing they found themselves
on the glacier. It was not smooth, as
Carl had at first thought, but was often cut
into deep furrows or piled into rough masses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look out, now, Carl. We must cross that
deep chasm ahead of us very carefully. It is
wider than it looks. Here! Follow me."</p>

<p>Fritz led the way to a place where the
chasm was narrow enough for him to spring
across with the aid of his mountain staff.
Carl followed, while Fritz reached over from
the other side and seized the boy as he landed.
Carl laughed. He wasn't the least bit frightened.</p>

<p>"I think you did that because of what
mother said, Uncle Fritz. You act as though
I were a child, but I am very sure-footed and
have been in slippery places before."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that, Carl. You are a brave
boy, too. But it is very easy to make a misstep
in such a place. I shouldn't like it very
much if you were down at the bottom of that
chasm at this moment. It wouldn't be easy
getting you up again, even though it is not
deep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Here and there the two travellers met
little streams of water flowing along over the
surface. The day had been quite warm for
this time of the year, the ice had melted a
little, and the water was running off in these
streams.</p>

<p>"O, uncle, look!" cried Carl, as they came
near another chasm in the glacier. "Here is
another bridge of ice over which we can cross.
How clear it is; it looks like glass."</p>

<p>By this time the moon was shining in all
her glory. "It is like fairy-land," said Carl
to himself as he looked back at the glacier
which they were just leaving, and then onward
to the mountain-tops in the distance, lighted
up by the soft yellow light.</p>

<p>"The mountains are God's true temples,
aren't they?" said Fritz, after a few moments.
"But come, my dear, it is getting late. We
must move quickly now, even though we are
tired. The lights in the village above us are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
calling, 'Hurry, hurry, good people, before we
sleep for the night!'"</p>

<p>It had been a long, hard day, but Carl had
enjoyed every moment. That night as he lay
in the warm bed prepared for him, he thought
it all over before he slept.</p>

<p>How kind these new friends were, too.
Although he and his uncle had reached the
village so late, a warm supper was made ready
for them at once and everything done for their
comfort. Why, the good woman of the house
had even taken a hot stone from the hearth
and put it into Carl's bed.</p>

<p>"I want you to sleep warm, my boy," she
said, as she kissed him good night, "and it
must be colder up here than in your own home
in the valley."</p>

<p>The next day Carl had a chance to look
around the little village. You would hardly
call it a village, either. There were only six or
eight houses. Their roofs were weighted down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with rocks, like the cottage where Carl had
stayed through the summer. It was the only
way to be sure of safety, for the winter winds
blew fiercely here; Carl knew that. There
were long months when the cows must stay in
their stable, week after week.</p>

<p>"But how neat the barn is!" exclaimed the
boy. "It is almost like a sitting-room.
Your father has a table and chairs here, as
though he stayed here a good deal of the
time."</p>

<p>"Yes, father likes his cattle so much, he
wishes to be with them all he can," answered
Marie, who was the only child in the house
where Carl and his uncle were staying.</p>

<p>"Don't you think our cows are lovely, and
did you notice the big black one in the first
stall? She is the queen of the herd. Father
let me name her, and so I called her 'Marie,'
after myself."</p>

<p>"O, yes, I noticed her first of all," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Carl. "I should think you would like it here
better in summer than in winter. Aren't you
ever afraid of avalanches, Marie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Carl. Sometimes I lie awake
and tremble all night. I can't help it.
That is when the wind blows very hard and
the house rocks to and fro. Then I think of
the great drifts of snow above us on the
mountain. What if they should start down
and come in this direction! There would be an
end of us; the whole village would be buried.</p>

<p>"Once last winter, I was wakened by a
terrible noise. I knew what it was at once.
It was an avalanche. It was coming this way
with a sound like thunder. I ran into
mother's room; she and father were on their
knees, praying. The danger lasted only a few
minutes and then all was still. But, do you
know, Carl, in the morning we had sad news.</p>

<p>"The house of a neighbour had been carried
away. His cattle were buried somewhere in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the great snowslide and were never heard of
again. But he and his family were safe
because they happened to be spending the
night with another neighbour."</p>

<p>"Was it a strong wind that caused the
avalanche that night?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"No, father said that could not have been
the reason. But you know that sometimes
even the cracking of a whip is enough to start
the dry snow in the winter-time. Then, as
it sweeps downward like a waterfall, more and
more is added to it and in a short time it
becomes a snowy torrent. O, it is fearful
then!" and Marie pressed her hands together
in fright at the very thought.</p>

<p>"You poor little girl. Don't talk about it
any more. I'm so sorry I said a word about
avalanches," said Carl. His voice was very
gentle, because he felt so sorry for Marie.
"Perhaps there won't be any more coming
down this side of the mountain," he added.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
"Then you will be just as safe as I am in my
home in the valley."</p>

<p>"Carl, Carl! where are you?" The words
came from the direction of the house. It was
Carl's uncle, who had wondered what had
become of the boy. The children came hurrying
out of the barn.</p>

<p>"It is growing dark, my dear, and I was
afraid you had wandered off somewhere," said
Fritz. "I promised your mother to look out
for you, Carl, so you see I am doing my
duty. Come into the house now. We will
have a pleasant evening with our good friends.
Then, with morning light, we must start on
our homeward way."</p>

<p>That night many stories were told of the
fairies and the gnomes. It is no wonder that
when Carl went to sleep he dreamed he was
living in a cave with the fairies, and that the
gnomes brought him a pile of gold heavy enough
to make him rich all the rest of his life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SANTA CLAUS NIGHT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was two weeks before Christmas. Carl
had been back from his visit to the mountain
village for more than a month. No harm had
come to him on his way home, although heavy
snow had fallen, which made hard walking. It
was worst of all in crossing the glacier, but the
boy's uncle took great care, and no accident
came to either of them.</p>

<p>And now the joyful day had come which
Carl liked best of all the year. He had saved
up money for months beforehand to buy
presents for his parents and his friend Franz.</p>

<p>What would he receive, himself? He
thought sometimes, "I wonder if father will
buy me a rifle. He thinks I can shoot pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
well now, I know that. But a rifle of my
own! That would be too good to be true."</p>

<p>It was the custom of Carl's village to have
the Christmas tree on Saint Claus's Day, two
weeks before the real Christmas Day. They
did not wait for the time at which we give the
presents. Christmas was a holiday, of course,
but it was somewhat like Sunday; everybody
went to church. There was a sermon, and
a great deal of music.</p>

<p>Saint Claus's Day was the time for fun and
frolic. Good children looked forward to that
day with gladness; but the bad children! dear
me! they trembled for fear they would be
carried off to some dreadful place by Saint
Claus's servant.</p>

<p>All the day before Carl was greatly excited.
He could hardly wait for night to come, but it
did come at last. The supper-table was
scarcely cleared before a loud knocking and
stamping of feet could be heard outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Rudolf hurried to open the door, while Carl
clapped his hands. Who should enter but
a jolly-looking old fellow with rosy cheeks
and twinkling eyes. He was dressed from
head to foot in furs. Surely this was Santa
Claus himself. There was a great pack of
goodies on his back. Carl could see the red
apples and bags of candy sticking out.</p>

<p>But who was the creature that followed
Santa Claus? His face was black, his clothes
were black, everything about him was black
as soot. He carried a broom over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"This is my servant," said Santa in a big,
strong voice. "I hope the child in this house
has been good. I just called at a place where
there was a boy who had not minded his
mother. I was going to let my servant carry
him off, but he promised to be good, so I forgave
him this time." Santa Claus tried to
scowl fiercely while he said these words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you been a good boy?" he cried,
suddenly turning toward Carl.</p>

<p>"O, yes, sir, I have tried hard," answered
the boy, who was half afraid, although, somehow,
this same Santa Claus spoke very much
like a friend of the family who lived near by.</p>

<p>"Very well, then." With this, Santa covered
the floor with nuts and fruit which he
shook out of his pack. A party of men who
had followed him and his servant into the
house, and were dressed up in all sorts of
funny ways, laughed and joked with Carl's
father and mother.</p>

<p>After a few moments of fun, Santa Claus
went away, first wishing the boy and his parents
good night and a merry day on the morrow.
They had many more calls to make
before their work would be done, and they
must hurry on their way, they said.</p>

<p>When the door was closed, Carl said,
"Father, I don't believe that is the real Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Claus; it is neighbour Hans, who has dressed
up like him. I knew his voice, too."</p>

<p>Carl danced around the room laughing,
while his father and mother laughed, too.</p>

<p>"When I was a little tot," Carl went on,
"I used to be scared, I tell you. I was afraid
of doing naughty things all the year for fear
mother would tell Santa Claus, and his servant
would then sweep me away with his broom.
Oh, I know better now." And Carl ran first
to his father, and then to his mother, and gave
each of them a hearty kiss.</p>

<p>The next morning, when he came downstairs,
there was the dearest little fir-tree in the
corner of the room, and under it lay some mittens
and stockings, besides the rifle for which
Carl had hoped and longed.</p>

<p>"Santa Claus helped me get them," said
Rudolf, and they all sat down to breakfast
laughing at the merry joke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE WONDERFUL ABBEY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the beautiful spring-time, and the
country had begun to look green and fresh
again after the long months of snow and frost.</p>

<p>"Carl, my dear, how would you like to go
on a pilgrimage to the Blessed Abbey?" asked
his father one night as they finished milking
the cows. "Easter Sunday is almost here, and
the people of the village are talking of going
to Einsiedeln together."</p>

<p>"O, father, that would make me happier
than anything else in the world. What a fine
time we can have! And only to think that
I can see the place with my own eyes. Do
you really mean it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, but do you think you can
walk so far without getting tired out?"</p>

<p>Carl laughed. "Look at me, father; see
how I have grown since last summer," and the
boy stretched to make himself seem as tall as
possible.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Your mother knows
about it, and is getting things ready for the
journey now."</p>

<p>The next three days Carl could think of
nothing else. He was full of excitement. The
night before they were to start, he said to his
father:</p>

<p>"Please tell me the story of the Wonderful
Abbey again. I wish to have the picture still
brighter in my mind as we journey along our
way to-morrow."</p>

<p>Rudolf leaned back in his chair. His face
was lighted by a happy smile as he said:</p>

<p>"Carl, my dear child, I love to think of the
good souls who have made this world so beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
by living in it. Yes, they have made it
more beautiful than the grandest mountains or
the loveliest lakes can make it.</p>

<p>"One of those good men was the holy
Meinrad, who lived over a thousand years ago.
He came from Germany to teach the priests
at a small convent on the Lake of Zurich.
After a while he said, 'I will live the life of a
hermit in a little cell in the forest. I can best
worship God if I live alone.'</p>

<p>"So he went up on the mountainside and
made a hut, where he prayed and fasted day
after day. It is said that the wild beasts felt
his goodness, and would do him no harm.
Whenever there was need, he went out to do
good deeds among men. People heard of him
through all the country round. They came
to ask his advice when they were in trouble, or
to seek help in other ways.</p>

<p>"But one day two robbers came to Meinrad's
cell. They came with a bad purpose; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
thought he must have a store of gold hidden
away, and they wished to get it. The holy
man gave them food and drink, but what do
you think these wicked men did in return for
such kindness? They cruelly murdered him!
Then, finding no money, they hurried away.</p>

<p>"Meinrad had two birds who kept him
company in the lonely forest. They were
ravens, and had grown very tame, loving
their master dearly.</p>

<p>"When the murderers fled, these birds
followed them down the mountainside, across
the lake, and into the town. The men stopped
at an inn for food and rest. The birds flapped
their wings against the windows, and kept up
shrill cries. Every one in the inn wondered
what it could mean. When this had kept
up for several hours, the men thought, 'This
is a warning to us from Heaven. We will
confess what we have done.'</p>

<p>"They told the fearful story, and were put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to death by the angry people who heard it.
Ever since that time the place has been called
the Ravens' Inn, and two ravens were carved
out of stone and placed upon the wall. When
we go to Zurich, Carl, you shall see those
stone ravens, for they are still there."</p>

<p>"Now, please tell me about the holy abbey,
father," said Carl, "and how it was blessed by
the angels."</p>

<p>"After a while," his father went on, "the
priests, who had heard the story of Meinrad's
death, decided to build a grand church. It
was to be on the very spot where Meinrad's
cell had stood and he had been murdered. It
was a beautiful building. When it was entirely
finished, bishops and knights came to consecrate
it to the Lord. People gathered from
far and near to listen to the service.</p>

<p>"Now, it was the custom of the good
Bishop Conrad to pray at midnight. On the
night before the great day of consecration, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
arose for his usual prayer, and, as he did so,
was surprised to hear beautiful music in the
air around him. He listened closely. Behold!
it was the chorus of angels; they were
consecrating the chapel. He bowed his head
in wonder and awe.</p>

<p>"The next morning, when the people had
come together for the sacred service, the
bishop waited in silence till nearly noon, and
then he told the crowd of listeners what had
happened during the night. There was nothing
for him to do now; the angels had already
made this a holy place.</p>

<p>"But the people would not, could not,
believe it. They still pressed the bishop to
go on with the service. At last, he felt that
he could not satisfy them in any other way,
so had already begun, when a clear voice was
heard to say, 'Brother, do not go on; for see,
it is already consecrated.'</p>

<p>"Then the people were able to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that the bishop had spoken truly, and the
place was indeed a holy one now. Ever since
that time good Catholics of France and Germany,
as well as from our own country, make
pilgrimages to the abbey of Einsiedeln. It is
now a very grand building. Thousands and
thousands of dollars have been spent to make
it beautiful.</p>

<p>"And Carl, dear, you shall see there the
very image of Jesus and Mary which the good
priest Meinrad brought to the place when he
first sought his home there. Better still, my
boy, you shall drink from the fountain from
which Jesus himself once drank, as I have
been told."</p>

<p>Carl listened closely to his father's words.
Others might tell him afterward that this was
only a legend, but he was an earnest little
Catholic, and believed that every word of it
was true.</p>

<p>The moment of starting came at last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Rudolf, with his wife and Carl, was joined by
several others of the village people. Franz was
among them, together with his parents. There
were many, many miles to walk, and several
days must be spent upon the way. The nights
were passed at taverns along the roadside.
As our friends journeyed onward, they were
joined by other parties, all going in the same
direction,&mdash;to the abbey blessed by the angels.</p>

<p>In one party there was a blind man, who
hoped to see again after he had drunk from
the wonderful fountain. In another, there was
a person who was lame, and who moved painfully
along on crutches. He believed he
would be able to leave these crutches behind
him if he could once reach the abbey.</p>

<p>As Carl drew nearer and nearer, he could
see that thousands and thousands of people
were all going the same way. And now as
they began to climb the mountainside, there
were crosses at every turn in the road. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
never passed them by without stopping to
kneel and pray.</p>

<p>He was a stout little fellow, as we know,
but he was growing very tired now. His feet
were quite sore, and there were deep cuts in
the soles. This showed that he had walked
very many miles over the hard roads. But
there were many others like him who had
never travelled so far from home before; and
some of them were old and feeble, too. He
would not let his mother think he was tired.
Oh, no, not for the world.</p>

<p>Ah! the spires were at last in sight, and
every one hurried forward.</p>

<p>It was very, very beautiful, Carl thought,
when he had passed through the great doorway,
and looked upon the wonderful sight
within. He had never before seen anything
half so grand. The walls and ceilings were
richly gilded, and there were many statues in
the nooks and corners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>But best of all was the precious image of
the Divine Child and His mother. It was
only a clumsy-looking little wooden figure,
and was black with age, but it was adorned
with precious stones that sparkled brilliantly.</p>

<p>Before Carl entered the sacred building, he
first stopped at the fountain, and drank from
each one of the fourteen spouts. This alone
would make his life better, he thought. But
after he had received a blessing from the priest
within the church, and had touched the marble
on which the image of Jesus rested, he could
go away perfectly happy.</p>

<p>There were many small inns in the village,
and you may be sure that they were well filled
at this time. Carl's family were together with
their friends at one of them, and they had a
merry time. When they were well rested,
however, Carl's father said to the boy:</p>

<p>"We will take a trip to Zurich before going
home. It is only a few miles away, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
promised to show you the stone ravens, you
know. An old friend of mine lives right on
the shore of the lake, and he will be glad
to have us lodge with him."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i137.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="Group of people on boat on lake" />
<div class="caption">ON THE LAKE.</div>
</div>

<p>What a lively place Zurich seemed to the
little country boy. Every one was so busy,
and there was so much going on all the time.</p>

<p>"Why is it such a busy place, father?"
asked Carl.</p>

<p>"It is largely because of the business in
silk, Carl. We do not raise silk in Switzerland;
it is too cold. But the cocoons are
brought here from Italy, and thousands of
people are kept busy in spinning, weaving and
dyeing the precious stuff.</p>

<p>"The wife of my good friend is at her loom
every moment she can spare from the work of
her house. But she tells me the pay is very
poor, yet the rich man who gives her the work
sells the silk for great prices. Ah! it is hard
to be poor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, it was true. Nearly every little home
around the lake had its loom, and one could
hear the whirr and the click in the houses as
he passed along.</p>

<p>Carl took trips on the pretty steamboats on
the lake. They had been built in the city
and Rudolf took the boy to the shipyard
where others were being made.</p>

<p>"All the iron steamers of Switzerland are
built here," he said, "besides others which
are sent to Italy and Austria. Yes, it is a
great and busy place."</p>

<p>"Our schoolmaster told us once that people
call these lakes of ours 'the eyes of the earth.'
Don't you think that is a pretty idea, father?
They are very bright and clear, as they lie
walled in between the mountains.</p>

<p>"And, father, he says that there were
people living on these lakes ages and ages
ago. It was before any history was written,
even."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then how do they know that such people
lived on the lakes?" asked Rudolf.</p>

<p>"Whole rows of piles have been discovered
under the water. Many were found right
here in Lake Zurich. They must once have
reached up much higher, but have rotted
away!"</p>

<p>"Is that the only proof that people built
their houses out over the water, Carl?"</p>

<p>"O, no, the schoolmaster says that many
tools have been found in the beds of earth
between the piles. They were almost all of
stone. Besides these, there were things to use
in housekeeping, and nets for fishing, and
cloth, and even embroidery."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I never happened to hear of
these strange people before," exclaimed Rudolf.
"What name did the master give them,
Carl?"</p>

<p>"He called them Lake-dwellers, because
they built their houses out over the water."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does he know any more about them and
why they chose such queer places for their
homes instead of the pretty valleys or
mountainsides?"</p>

<p>"He said it must have been in a warlike
time and probably these people felt safer to
dwell in this way. You see they could easily
defend themselves in such places. Yet they
had some farms and gardens, so they did not
stay there all the time.</p>

<p>"They had very queer homes. The floors
were made of round sticks, laid side by side.
The chinks were filled in with clay and rushes.
The roofs were made of straw and rushes put
on in layers."</p>

<p>"How strange this all is. I don't really
see how so much could be discovered," said
Rudolf, half to himself. Then he went on,
"I suppose they had no cows or other domestic
animals, of course."</p>

<p>"O, yes, they had, father." Carl was proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to think he could tell his father so many
things about them. "They had cattle, and
sheep, and goats, and pigs; and they kept
them in stalls in these lake dwellings.</p>

<p>"Why, only think! though it was three
thousand years ago, probably, these people
not only fished and hunted, but they spun
flax and wove cloth. They made bread of
wheat and other grains to eat with the fish
they caught and the deer they killed. They
must have known quite a deal to do that, even
if they didn't write books to tell about themselves.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Carl, I certainly think so. But come,
it is getting late and we must go back to your
mother and our friends. To-morrow we shall
leave them and turn our faces toward our own
little home. Are you ready for the long
tramp?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my feet are tough now, and I don't
believe they will get so sore as they did in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
coming. What a lovely time I have had.
You are such a good, kind father to bring me
here, as well as to the chapel of the holy
Meinrad."</p>

<p>Carl looked up at Rudolf with such a happy
face that his father bent down and kissed him.</p>
